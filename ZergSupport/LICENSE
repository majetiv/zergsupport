All the code in the ZerglingNet libraries, except for the Google Toolbox for Mac
code in TestSupport, is released under the MIT license, contained in the file
MIT-LICENSE. Files not licensed under the MIT license are clearly marked as
such.


TestSupport contains code from the Google Toolbox for Mac, which is copyrighted
to Google Inc., and is released under the Apache License, Version 2.0, contained
in the file TestSupport/GTM/COPYING.


NOT TO BE TAKEN AS LEGAL ADVICE: you should be able to safely ignore the
Apache License in TestSupport, as long as:
(1) you only #include "TestSupport.h" in your test code
(2) your release binaries don't contain any test code
(3) you don't plan to sue Google

All 3 points look like good development practices.
