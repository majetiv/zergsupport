ZergSupport is a toolkit for iPhone OS applications that communicate with Web
services. As a toolkit, the ZergSupport library provides a collection of classes
designed to simplify certain tasks. The library does not impose an application
design philosophy like a framework would, and it does not extend Apple-supplied
classes, so it can coexist with other framework code. ZergSupport is liberally
licensed under the OSI-approved non-viral MIT license.

The ZergSupport code is restricted to methods in the official SDK, so that it
can be used in App Store applications. The initial version of ZergSupport is
used by in StockPlay, which passed Apple's approval process, and is currently
ready for sale in the App Store.

The code in ZergSupport is completely covered by tests, which also serve as
usage examples. The rest of this README provides a conceptual map of the code.


INSTALLATION

An easy method for incorporating ZergSupport is using the zerg_xcode tool, which
was written with this express purpose. The generic method for incorporating
library code using zerg_xcode is described in detail at:

TARGETS

ZergSupport provides 3 targets:
* ZergSupport includes "production" code that should be shipped with iPhone
  applications using the library. This library should be included in the iPhone
  application target.
* ZergTestSupport includes ZergSupport, and adds code that can be helpful in
  writing your own tests. This library should be included in test targets. The
  test targets do not need to include ZergSupport directly.
* ZergSupportTests contains the test code for the ZergSupport toolkit. The test
  cases have been separated from ZergTestSupport so you don't have to run them
  every time you change your own code.


SERVICES

ModelSupport tries to fill the gap Apple created by leaving out Core Data. Model
classes inherit from ZNModel, and specify their attributes by declaring
properties. ModelSupport models are designed with Web interaction in mind, and
therefore can handle attributes that are not specified are development time.
These attributes are preserved during serialization and deserialization, so
they can be used in future versions of the application, and when exchanging
models with Web services or other applications.

WebSupport is a one-method API for asynchronous data exchange with Web services.
It can encode parameters into the format that makes HTTP servers happy, and
it decodes responses in multiple formats (currently XML, CSV, and raw data). The
API seamlessly encodes and decodes ModelSupport models, and transparently
supports local: URLs, which wouldn't work with NSURLConnection.

ControllerSupport has reusable logic for controllers communicating with Web
servers. Currently, it provides reusable data synchronization logic, and a
NSView-independent implementation of the Target-Action model.

FormatSupport is the string crunching backend of WebSupport. It's responsible
for encoding to x-www-url-encoded, decoding from XML and CSV, and converting
between different casing conventions.

TestSupport offers a healthy foundation for testing, by packing the necessary
subset of the Google Toolbox for Mac. On top of that, it supports Rails-like
fixtures for ModelSupport models. TestSupport is only included in the testing
targets, so you don't have to worry about the APL license that comes with
Google's code.


CONTRIBUTING

If you find ZergSupport useful, and want to give back, the easiest way is to
improve the existing documentation. The next step up is implementing new
functionality, or fixing bugs. This can be demanding, because I care a lot about
maintaining full test coverage. To compensate for that, I will be happy to help
out with directions and ideas, or brainstorm on means of testing new code. You 
must be prepared to assign the copyright of your contributions to Zergling.Net,
and have your code released under the MIT license, to keep licensing legals
simple for ZergSupport's users. 

If your employment conditions or philosophy prevent you from contributing to
ZergSupport by development, you can buy StockPlay from the App Store, and thus
contribute indirectly.
